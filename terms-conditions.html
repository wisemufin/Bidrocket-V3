    <h1>BidRocket, LLC</h1>
    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      <i>Updated July 18, 2019</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for using BidRocket, LLC (&#34;BidRocket&#34;) for your fundraising needs. The following terms and conditions apply to your use of the BidRocket web site, services and software (collectively, the &#34;Services&#34;). By using the Services, you (&#34;you&#34;, &#34;user&#34; or &#34;User&#34;, collectively, the &#34;Client&#34;) accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to use the BidRocket web site (the &#34;Web Site&#34;) or Services. By accepting these terms, you also agree that the Privacy Policy will apply whenever you use the BidRocket website.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidRocket, LLC reserves the right to edit, change, add or delete information in the terms without notice to the user.  All amended terms shall automatically be effective on the date they are posted on the BidRocket web site. A user&#39;s continued use of the BidRocket website constitutes an agreement to these updated terms. Please read the following Terms of Service carefully.
    </p>
    <h2>1. <b>USE OF SERVICES</b></h2>
    <p>
      The Services are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Additionally, it is our intent that the Services be used only by non-profit entities or by for-profit entities raising money on behalf of and for the exclusive benefit of a non-profit entity. BidRocket reserves the right to refuse our services to anyone at any time, in our sole discretion, if we believe there is an unlawful or unscrupulous use of the Website and our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as you remain in compliance with these Terms of Service, BidRocket grants you the right to use the Services as described herein. You agree that the Services constitutes a valuable property and trade secret of BidRocket and that BidRocket retains all intellectual property rights thereto (and to any related materials, information and processes). You agree not to modify, copy, disclose, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble or create derivative works from the Services or disclose or provide access to the Services to any unauthorized party. You agree not to remove or modify any of BidRocket&#39;s copyright and other proprietary notices included with the Services.

    </p>
    <p>
      If you violate any of these Terms of Service, your permission to use the Services automatically terminates and you must immediately cease your use of the Services.
    </p>
    <h2>2. <b>PAYMENT TERMS</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In order to utilize BidRocket&#39;s Software License and Support Services, you agree to pay a Contract Fee in accordance with the price quoted for your level of use of BidRocket&#39;s Software License and Support Services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          BidRocket, LLC engages Stripe as a third-party, online payment processor. To pay for Stripe&#39;s merchant processing services, a 3.5% credit card processing fee is assessed on all online credit card payments. When transacting through Stripe, it is necessary that BidRocket users be subject to the applicable <a href="https://stripe.com/us/ssa">Stripe Terms of Service</a>.  BidRocket is not affiliated with Stripe, and neither is the agent or employee of the other, and neither is responsible in any way for the actions or performance (or lack thereof) of the other.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with our site with a valid payment method. If your payment method fails, we may engage suitable collection methods.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All BidRocket fees are exclusive of any federal, state and local taxes. Payment of appropriate taxes to the proper tax authority is your responsibility. If your organization is a nonprofit entity with 501(c)(3) status, and is therefore exempt from Sales & Use Tax, you will need to provide evidence of your Tax Exemption form during your onboarding process. It is ultimately your responsibility to confirm with your local tax authorities any necessary tax payments due.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>All payments are final and non-refundable</b></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. <b>SERVICE PERIOD</b></h2>
    <p>
      BidRocket, LLC will endeavor to maintain your event data for a period of two years. During this time, you will be able to access event data and export reports.
    </p>
    <h2>4. <b>PASSWORD AND SECURITY</b></h2>
    <p>
      Every user of BidRocket must register on the BidRocket web site, or be registered by an administrator, in order to establish a unique personal login. <b>You are responsible for keeping your login information confidential. We recommend that you not share your login credentials with any other person.</b> You are responsible for all activity occurring through the use of your account with or without your knowledge. If you knowingly share your login information to another person, your account privileges may be suspended temporarily or terminated. You agree to immediately notify BidRocket of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your account. BidRocket cannot and will not be responsible for any loss to you arising from your failure to comply with the above. You agree to use software produced by third parties, including, but not limited to, &#34;browser&#34; software that supports a data security protocol compatible with the protocol used by BidRocket. Until notified otherwise by BidRocket, you agree to use software that supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by BidRocket and follow BidRocket&#39;s log-on procedures. You acknowledge that BidRocket is not responsible for notifying you of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of data transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities, including, but not limited to, the Internet. You acknowledge that it is possible that electronic communications may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated between you and BidRocket using the Internet, other network communications facilities, telephone or any other electronic means.
    </p>
    <h2>5. <b>ACCESS</b></h2>
    <p>
      In order to use the Services, you need the equipment necessary to connect to
      the World Wide Web, and the Internet connection necessary to access it. You
      are responsible for any fees associated with such connection or access (such as
      those charged by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other online service).
      You will also need an appropriate computer, related equipment, and software
      (your &#34;Computer&#34;). You are responsible for installing, maintaining, and operating
      your Computer. BidRocket is not responsible for any problems caused by your
      Computer, including any virus or related problems associated with your use of
      the Services on your Computer. We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or
      secure access to our services, and operation of the Web Site and Services may
      be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.
    </p>
    <h2>6. <b>ELECTRONIC MESSAGE DELIVERABILITY</b></h2>
    <p>
       The Services may include features enabling the sending of electronic messages
       via external networks that are outside of BidRocket&#39;s control. Examples include
       sending email messages via the Internet and sending text messages via short
       message service cellular networks. BidRocket makes no guarantee as to the
       deliverability of such messages. You acknowledge that BidRocket is not
       responsible for the delivery of electronic messages sent through the Bid
       Rocket service. Such messages may be delayed for an indeterminate period
       of time or may not be delivered at all.
    </p>
    <h2>7. <b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></h2>
    <p>
      The Web Site may contain links to third-party web sites. These
      links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an
      endorsement by BidRocket of the contents on such third-party web
      sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked third-party
      sites and do not make any representations regarding the content or
      accuracy of materials on such third-party web sites. If you decide to
      access linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk.
    </p>
    <h2>8. <b>SUPPORT POLICY</b></h2>
    <p>
      Technical support is provided exclusively via a web-based tutorial
      system and through email. We make every effort to respond to all support
      inquiries as quickly as possible during regular business hours, Monday
      through Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Central Time, excluding holidays. Support
      is provided only to users with an active BidRocket account.
      Live phone support is available to clients for an additional cost.
    </p>
    <h2>9. <b>LIMIT OF LIABILITY</b></h2>
    <p><b>
      IN NO EVENT SHALL BidRocket OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
      WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE)
      ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR RESULTING FROM THE
      USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES AND THE MATERIALS. OUR LIABILITY, AND
      THE LIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLIERS, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
      IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PAY TO US IN THE 12
      MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, AND (B) $100. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, SO THE FOREGOING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    </b></p>
    <h2>10. <b>NO WARRANTY</b></h2>
    <p>
      The Materials, including information obtained from independent suppliers not affiliated with BidRocket, is believed to be reliable, but may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors. We make no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, sequence or timeliness of the Materials or about the results obtained from using the Web Site, the Services or the Materials. The use of the Web Site, the Services and the Materials is at your own risk. Changes are periodically made to the Web Site and may be made at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidRocket, LLC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE WEB SITE WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE WEB SITE AND ITS SERVER ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER HARMFUL GOODS. IF YOUR USE OF THE WEB SITE OR THE MATERIALS RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, BidRocket, LLC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS. WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE WEB SITE AND THE SERVICES &#34;AS IS&#34; AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, <b>WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. BidRocket, LLC AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS
      OF THE MATERIALS, SERVICES, SOFTWARE, TEXT, GRAPHICS, AND LINKS.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. In such states, BidRocket&#39;s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. This warranty gives you specific legal rights
      and you may also have other legal rights which vary from state to state.
    </p>
    <h2>11. <b>BIDROCKET&#39;S ROLE</b></h2>
    <p>
      BidRocket&#39;s role is to facilitate fundraising events. We are not
      involved in the actual transaction between sellers and buyers, and,
      as such, we have no control over the delivery, quality, safety or
      legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings,
      the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for
      items. Therefore,
      we cannot guarantee that two parties will actually complete a transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an intermediary, we will not and cannot be involved in your organization&#39;s dealings. In the event that a dispute arises among one or more users, or between a buyer and a seller, you release BidRocket, LLC (and our officers, directors, employees and agents) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code &#167;1542, which says: &#34;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      For legal reasons, we cannot nor do we try to control
      the information provided by other users which is made available
      through our system. By its very nature, other people&#39;s information may
      be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled
      or deceptively labeled. We expect
      that you will use caution - and common sense - when using the Web Site.
