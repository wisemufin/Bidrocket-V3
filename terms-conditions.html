    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for using Bid Rocket, LLC (&#34;Bid Rocket&#34;) for your fundraising needs. The following terms and conditions apply to your use of the Bid Rocket web site, services and software (collectively, the &#34;Services&#34;). By using the Services, you (&#34;you&#34;, &#34;user&#34; or &#34;User&#34;, collectively, the &#34;Client&#34;) accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to use the Bid Rocket web site (the &#34;Web Site&#34;) or Services. By accepting these terms, you also agree that the Privacy Policy will apply whenever you use the Bid Rocket website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bid Rocket reserves the right to edit, change, add or delete information
      in the terms without notice to the user.  All amended terms shall
      automatically be effective on the date they are posted on the Bid Rocket
      web site. A user&#39;s continued use of the Bid Rocket web site constitutes an
      agreement to these updated terms.
      Please read the following Terms of Service carefully.
    </p>
    <h2>1. <b>USE OF SERVICES</b></h2>
    <p>
      The Services are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Additionally, it is our intent that the Services be used only by non-profit entities or by for-profit entities raising
      money on behalf of and for the exclusive benefit of a non-profit entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as you remain in compliance with these Terms of Service, Bid Rocket grants you the right to use the Services as described herein. You agree that the Services constitutes a valuable property and trade secret of Bid Rocket and that Bid Rocket retains all intellectual property rights thereto (and to any related materials, information and processes). You agree not to modify, copy, disclose, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble or create derivative works from the Services or disclose or provide access to the Services to any unauthorized party. You agree not to remove or modify any of Bid Rocket&#39;s copyright and other proprietary notices included with the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you violate any of these Terms of Service, your permission to use the Services automatically
      terminates and you must immediately cease your use of the Services.
    </p>
    <h2>2. <b>PAYMENT TERMS</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In order to utilize Bid Rocket&#39;s services, you agree to pay a 3% Platform Fee on all credit card transactions associated with a single event. This Platform Fee will not exceed $4,500 of credit card transactions processed through our third-party credit card payment processor, Stripe. The Platform Fee is exclusive
          of any costs associated with add-on features explained on our pricing page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify our pricing model and/or features at any time. These changes
          will become effective after we post such changes on the Bid Rocket web site.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          By using Bid Rocket, all users agree to Stripe withholding Bid Rocket&#39;s Platform Fee and making this fee available to Bid Rocket, LLC. When transacting through Stripe, it is necessary that Bid Rocket users be subject to the applicable Stripe Terms of Service.  Bid Rocket is not affiliated with Stripe, and neither is the agent or employee of the other, and neither is responsible
          in any way for the actions or performance (or lack thereof) of the other.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Users wishing to pay for additional features not covered in our core offering, may do so with a credit card or ACH electronic check payment.  All payments for these additional
          features must be paid in full in order to access the add-on features.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with our site with a valid payment method.
          If your payment method fails, we may engage suitable collection methods.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All Bid Rocket&#39;s fees are exclusive of any federal, state and local taxes. Payment of appropriate taxes to the proper tax authority is your responsibility. If your organization is a nonprofit entity with 501(c)(3) status, and is therefore exempt from Sales & Use Tax, you will need to provide evidence of your Tax Exemption form during your registration process. It is ultimately your responsibility
          to confirm with your local tax authorities any necessary tax payments due.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your organization and administrators accept the responsibility to provide refunds to users at their own discretion.
          Bid Rocket, LLC will not be held liable for refunds to your users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>All payments are final and non-refundable</b></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. <b>SERVICE PERIOD</b></h2>

      You will also need an appropriate computer, related equipment, and software
      (your &#34;Computer&#34;). You are responsible for installing, maintaining, and operating

       deliverability of such messages. You acknowledge that Bid Rocket is not

    <p>
      The Materials, including information obtained from independent suppliers not affiliated with Bid Rocket, is believed to be reliable, but may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors.

    </p>
    <p>
      Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. In such states, Bid Rocket&#39;s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. This warranty gives you specific legal rights

    <h2>11. <b>BID ROCKET'S ROLE</b></h2>
    <p>
      Bid Rocket&#39;s role is to facilitate fundraising events. We are not
      involved in the actual transaction between sellers and buyers, and,
      as such, we have no control over the delivery, quality, safety or
      legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings,
      the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for
      items. Therefore,
      we cannot guarantee that two parties will actually complete a transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an intermediary, we will not and cannot be involved in your organization&#39;s dealings. In the event that a dispute arises among one or more users, or between a buyer and a seller, you release Bid Rocket, LLC (and our officers, directors, employees and agents) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: &#34;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      For legal reasons, we cannot nor do we try to control
      the information provided by other users which is made available
      through our system. By its very nature, other people&#39;s information may
      be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled
      or deceptively labeled. We expect
      that you will use caution – and common sense – when using the Web Site.
